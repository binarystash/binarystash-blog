Since I downloaded this game, I have been hooked up to it. Graphics is superb and gameplay is unique. I believe that it is impossible to complete this game with just skill so I decided to purchase credits which gave me additional "energy" and  unlimited access to the "recharge node". This has become my new favorite after Angry Birds.
