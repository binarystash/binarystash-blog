####[Types - Custom Fields and Custom Post Types Management 1.3.1](http://wordpress.org/plugins/types/)

This plugin provides a user-friendly interface for creating and managing custom post types, taxonomies, and fields. Custom types and their data can be easily used in templates through the plugin's well-documented API.

####[Category Order and Taxonomy Terms Order 1.3.4](http://wordpress.org/plugins/taxonomy-terms-order/)

Since Wordpress doesn't currently have a drag-and-drop interface for ordering taxonomies, this plugin provides just that. It works well with hierarchical taxonomies created by Types.

####[Taxonomy Images 0.7.3](http://wordpress.mfields.org/plugins/taxonomy-images/)

If you need to associate photos with taxonomies, this will help you by placing photo upload fields in the taxonomy panel. Again, it works well with taxonomies created by Types.
