I own an old PC equipped with ECS 865GV-M3 motherboard that despite being capable of booting thru USB doesn't allow you to in its own boot manager.

Thankfully, [Plop Linux](http://www.plop.at/en/ploplinux.html#intro) solves the problem. It's full-featured Linux rescue distro that can be started via PXE. Its boot manager gives me the option to boot via USB.
