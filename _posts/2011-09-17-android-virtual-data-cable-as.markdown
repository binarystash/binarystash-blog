After upgrading to Gingerbread 2.3.3, I could no longer root my phone. Hence, the trusty "Samba Filesharing" app for Android no longer worked.

 I now use [Virtual Data Cable](https://market.android.com/details?id=ustc.lfr.ftp) which uses FTP to transfer files between my PC and phone. After creating the FTP shortcut on my desktop, I can transfer files as easily as I would using "Samba Filesharing".
